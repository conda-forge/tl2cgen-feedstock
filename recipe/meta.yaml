  summary: TL2cgen (TreeLite 2 C GENerator)

  description: |
    TL2cgen is a model compiler for decision tree models.
    You can convert any decision tree models (random forests,
    gradient boosting models) into C code and distribute it
    as a native binary. TL2cgen seamlessly integrates with Treelite.
    Any tree models that are supported by Treelite can be
    translated using TL2cgen.
